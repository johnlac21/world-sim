WORLD SIM BBGM — PROOF OF CONCEPT (GAME DESIGN OVERVIEW)

VERSION: 0.1 (HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN DOCUMENT / PROOF OF CONCEPT)
GOAL: Capture the core vision, gameplay loop, and simulation structure of a BBGM-style life-and-society management game.

========================================================

HIGH-LEVEL PITCH
========================================================

World Sim BBGM is a browser-based management sim that takes the design philosophy of Basketball GM (BBGM) and applies it to a living world of people, industries, and governments.

Instead of managing a sports team, the player manages a country’s “roster” of people across:

A small set of global INDUSTRIES with fixed hierarchies (President, VP, senior roles).

A GOVERNMENT hierarchy that acts as the highest-stakes competitive layer.

A POPULATION pipeline where youth develop into adults, enter careers, move between countries, and form families.

The game emphasizes:

Deterministic stats: a person’s ratings visibly determine their performance.

Clear hierarchies: every important role lives in a tree the player can understand.

Development curves: people get better, peak, and decline over time.

Annual competition: each year, countries are ranked on industry output, government performance, and population well-being, producing “championships” and dynasties.

Core fantasy:
“You are the architect of a country’s elite talent and institutions across decades, watching industries, governments, and generations rise and fall under your management.”

========================================================
2. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

2.1 BBGM-AS-FOUNDATION
The game deliberately mirrors BBGM’s core ideas:

Manage people, not abstract policies.

Use clear rating systems and development arcs.

Provide deterministic, interpretable stats.

Structure time around a repeating competitive loop (seasons/years).

Track history: awards, championships, dynasties, Hall of Fame.

2.2 NOT A PURE GOVERNMENT SIM
This is not a “tax rate and policy slider” government simulator. The focus is on:

People in roles.

Performance in structured hierarchies.

Talent pipelines and rosters.

Organizational output, not low-level legislative detail.

2.3 NOT A PURE LIFE SIM
Individual day-to-day life is abstracted. The focus is:

Careers, performance, influence, and legacy.

Families and reproduction as part of the talent pipeline.

Personality and stats driving aggregate behavior, not micro-RPG choices.

2.4 SYSTEMS-FIRST, BUT GAME-DRIVEN
The simulation is rich enough to be interesting on its own, but always serves gameplay:

Stats always have visible effects.

Roles always matter.

Each year generates meaningful “content” for the player: promotions, declines, breakthroughs, rankings, awards.

========================================================
3. CORE ENTITIES AND HIERARCHIES

3.1 COUNTRIES

The world contains N countries (e.g., 5–10).

Each country has:

A population (adults + youth).

Access to the same set of global industries.

Its own government hierarchy.

Its own score each year (like a team record).

3.2 INDUSTRIES

There is a small number of global industries (e.g., 3):
Example: Technology, Finance, Research (or similar thematic categories).

Each industry exists in every country and has a fixed hierarchy of roles, such as:

Industry President (top role per country per industry).

Vice President.

Senior Directors / Managers.

A fixed number of subordinate roles (e.g., ~10).

Top roles (President, VP, certain senior positions) have multi-year contracts.

Lower roles can be reassigned at any time.

3.3 GOVERNMENT

Each country has a government hierarchy, which is the “premier league” of the game.

Positions might include:

President / Prime Minister (head of state/government).

Key ministers (Economy, Education, Industry, etc.).

A small supporting cast of high-level officials.

Government roles are more demanding and use more well-rounded stat requirements than industry roles.

The government’s effectiveness strongly influences a country’s yearly score.

3.4 POPULATION

Every person in the world has:

Core stats (cognitive, social, etc.).

A potential and development style.

A set of personality traits.

A current age and life stage.

A current role:

In an industry hierarchy.

In government.

In a generic non-interactive job.

Unemployed or retired.

People are associated with:

A country.

Optional family/parents.

A career history.

A marriage/family history.

3.5 CAREER PIPELINES

Youth appear around age 15–16 in a “youth” pool (like prospects).

At age 18, they enter the “valid adult” pool and become eligible for:

University education (if selected / qualified).

Entry-level roles in industries.

Low-level government or generic roles.

High-potential youth can be steered (via education and role assignments) into high-level careers.

3.6 INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT

People can move between countries:

For better salaries.

For more prestigious industries.

For better government roles.

This functions like free agency rather than trading:

No rigid trade mechanic.

Movement driven by stats, salary, prestige, and personality.

========================================================
4. STATS AND DETERMINISTIC PERFORMANCE

4.1 STAT CATEGORIES
Each person has a set of ratings similar to sports sims but applied to life and industry:

Cognitive stats (e.g., intelligence, judgment, creativity, discipline).

Social/leadership stats (e.g., charisma, leadership, communication, negotiation).

Reliability and integrity stats (e.g., discipline, integrity, stability).

Possibly some domain-specific modifiers (e.g., technical aptitude for Tech industry).

4.2 DEVELOPMENT CURVES

Starting from age 18:

Rapid improvement from ~18–30.

Plateau through early-mid 30s.

Gradual decline from mid-30s onward.

Steeper decline after 40–45, especially in certain stats.

Each person has:

A potential rating that defines their ceiling.

A development style (early/normal/late bloomer) that shifts peak age and growth shape.

Variation between stat categories (e.g., social vs cognitive vs reliability).

4.3 DETERMINISTIC OUTPUT
Stats must produce visible, interpretable outcomes:

Industry output:

Employee productivity is a deterministic function of relevant stats.

Aggregate company/industry performance is derived from employee performance.

Government output:

Policy success and stability are influenced by leaders’ stats.

High-judgment, high-integrity leaders yield better outcomes.

Career progress:

Promotions and role suitability scores come from stats.

National performance:

A country’s yearly score is derived from industry output, government effectiveness, and population well-being, all stat-driven.

The key idea: a person with a high “Industry Talent” rating in Tech will consistently be more productive and impactful than a low-rated person, just like a high 3PT rating leads to better shooting stats in BBGM.

========================================================
5. TIME MODEL AND SIMULATION CADENCE

5.1 DAILY TICKS (MICRO LEVEL)
On a day-to-day basis (internally):

Employees perform work:

Their productivity contributes to company/industry performance.

Government operates:

Minor shifts in approval, stability, and policy effectiveness occur.

Health and aging:

Time passes and minor age-related risk accumulates.

Social interactions happen in aggregate:

Relationship scores nudge up or down based on personality/stats, but this is abstracted.

The player does not necessarily inspect each day individually; daily ticks are mostly for internal consistency and fine-grained change.

5.2 WEEKLY / MONTHLY SUMMARIES (PLAYER-FACING “BOX SCORES”)
Every week or month, the game can generate reports:

Top performers in each industry.

Underperformers and declining figures.

Changes in industry output.

Movement in approval and stability.

Standout youth performances in university.

Notable events: promotions, firings, scandals, breakthroughs.

These reports are the analog of “box scores” and weekly recaps in BBGM.

5.3 YEARLY CYCLE (THE “SEASON”)
The primary loop is yearly, just like a sports season:

Each year:

People age by 1.

Youth graduate into adulthood.

Retirements and deaths are processed.

Major promotions and leadership changes are considered.

International movement happens.

A world ranking is computed.

At the end of each year:

Awards are given.

A “champion” country is crowned.

Historical records are updated.

Each year is the main “season” step, equivalent to BBGM’s season cycle.

========================================================
6. INDUSTRIES AS BBGM-STYLE ORGANIZATIONS

6.1 STRUCTURE

Each industry has the same role structure in every country, e.g.:

President (1)

Vice President (1)

Senior Director (2–4)

Manager (3–6)

Specialist / Staff (fixed number, e.g., 10)

Total number of important roles per industry per country is small (e.g., 15–20), making it easy to browse and reason about.

6.2 ASSIGNMENT AND CONTRACTS

High-level roles (President, VP, Senior Director):

Assigned via multi-year contracts (e.g., 3–5 years).

Contract details include:

Duration.

Salary.

Possibly a role prestige indicator.

Lower roles (Manager, Specialist):

Assigned more freely.

Can be replaced without large penalties.

6.3 PERFORMANCE STATS
Workers generate industry-specific performance stats, for example:

Base productivity index.

Advanced metrics:

Value Generated Above Replacement (VgAR).

Contribution to innovation.

Team leadership/cohesion impact.

These stats update on a frequent cadence (weekly/monthly) and are visible in tables and leaderboards.

6.4 INDUSTRY IMPACT ON COUNTRY
Each industry contributes to the country’s overall yearly performance by:

Providing productivity and innovation scores.

Affecting employment and income.

Influencing national prestige and attractiveness to migrants.

The player optimizes the assignment of talent into industry hierarchies to maximize output and competitive standing.

========================================================
7. GOVERNMENT AS THE PREMIER COMPETITIVE LAYER

7.1 HIERARCHY
Government is treated as the highest-level league:

President / Prime Minister.

Key ministers (e.g., Economy, Education, Industry, Interior).

A handful of high-level officials.

These roles are fewer but more impactful than industry roles.

7.2 DEMANDS AND STAT REQUIREMENTS

Government roles require a broader mix of stats:

Leadership, integrity, judgment, charisma, communication, stability.

Poorly suited leaders:

Lower stability.

Worse policy outcomes.

Higher risk of scandals or crises.

Strong leaders:

Raise the country’s effectiveness and score.

7.3 COMPETITIVE METRICS
Government performance is measured via:

Stability/approval.

Effective implementation of broad initiatives.

Crisis avoidance or management.

Long-term national well-being indicators.

This performance directly influences the yearly ranking and “championship” outcome.

7.4 ELECTIONS AND TERMS (LATER-STAGE FEATURE)
Initially, government roles may be appointed. In more advanced versions:

Elections can be simulated.

Voters respond to candidates’ stats, performance, and personality.

Term limits enforce leadership rotation.

Election cycles add drama and strategic planning.

========================================================
8. POPULATION, FAMILY, AND CAREER PIPELINES

8.1 INITIAL POPULATION
At world creation:

Each country starts with:

A small adult population (e.g., 100–200 valid adults aged 18–50).

A background youth population (children) that will surface as teenagers.

Adults are seeded with:

Stats, personality, and potential.

Basic career history (some generic jobs, some already in industries/government).

8.2 YOUTH EMERGENCE

Youth appear in a “Youth” view/tab around age 15–16.

At 18:

They join the adult pool.

They can attend university (if selected or if they qualify).

They can enter early career roles.

8.3 EDUCATION PATHWAY

Promising youth may attend university:

University acts like a high-level “development accelerator.”

Graduates are more competitive for industry and government roles.

Education accelerates:

Cognitive and domain-related stats.

Career outcomes.

8.4 MARRIAGE AND REPRODUCTION

Adults have personality-driven probabilities of:

Entering relationships.

Marrying.

Having children.

The player may optionally:

Match couples manually within certain limits (e.g., for roleplay or dynastic goals).

Children:

Inherit a mixture of parents’ stats and environment (income, roles).

Enter the youth pipeline later.

8.5 RETIREMENT, GENERIC JOBS, AND UNEMPLOYMENT

Not everyone is in industries or government.

Some adults:

Occupy generic jobs (abstracted, non-interactive).

Are unemployed (with a risk of dropping out of the competitive pool).

Retire fully in old age.

The simulation represents the broader population without requiring micromanagement of every person.

8.6 INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT

People can move between countries if:

They are attracted by higher salaries.

They seek more prestigious industries or governments.

Their personality (ambition, risk-taking) pushes them to move.

This creates:

Talent flows.

“Brain drain” and “talent import” dynamics.

The player can leverage these flows by:

Offering better roles.

Building a more prestigious country.

========================================================
9. YEARLY COMPETITION AND SCORING

9.1 YEARLY EVALUATION
At the end of each year, the game computes a score for each country based on:

Industry output:

Aggregated productivity and innovation across all industries.

Government effectiveness:

Stability and quality of decisions.

Population well-being:

Abstracted metrics like prosperity, education level, and talent density.

9.2 WORLD RANKING AND “CHAMPION”
Countries are ranked by total score:

#1 is declared the “World Champion” for that year.

The ranking table is displayed similarly to league standings in BBGM.

9.3 IMPACT OF PERFORMANCE

High-performing countries:

Gain prestige.

Attract more talent.

Have an easier time retaining high performers.

Low-performing countries:

Lose prestige.

Suffer talent exit.

May experience more instability.

This feedback loop reinforces the importance of good talent allocation and leadership.

9.4 MULTI-YEAR DYNASTIES
Over time:

Some countries may dominate for years, forming dynasties.

Others may rise from weak to strong through player skill and luck.

Historical records capture these arcs.

========================================================
10. AWARDS, HISTORY, AND LEGACY

10.1 INDIVIDUAL AWARDS
Each year, the game grants awards such as:

All-Industry Teams (e.g., “Tech First Team,” “Finance First Team”).

All-Government Team.

Industry MVP (most productive or impactful individual).

Government MVP (most impactful political figure).

Rising Star awards (top young talents).

Executive/President of the Year.

These are based on the deterministic stats and performance metrics produced in that year.

10.2 COUNTRY-LEVEL HISTORY

Country History page includes:

List of yearly rankings and championship wins.

Past presidents/government leaders.

Past industry presidents and notable executives.

Notable emergent dynasties (families with repeated impact).

Major events (e.g., “Golden Decade of Tech,” crisis years).

10.3 HALL OF FAME AND LEGACY

Exceptional individuals are inducted into a Hall of Fame if they:

Attain multiple awards.

Drive a long period of dominance.

Have exceptional career values above replacement.

Hall of Fame entries show:

Career timeline.

Award history.

Key stats and contributions.

This provides long-term goals and emotional attachment.

10.4 REPLAYABILITY THROUGH HISTORY

Each save/world accumulates a rich legacy.

Players can:

Restart with new seeds.

Compare dynasties between saves.

Try to build different kinds of dominant countries (industry-heavy, government-heavy, talent-factory, etc.).

========================================================

Explore how different strategies perform:

Government-heavy vs industry-heavy focus.

Tech-focused vs finance-focused dominance.

“Homegrown talent” vs importing foreign elites.

========================================================
12. SCOPE AND MVP

For a minimum viable product (MVP), the core pieces are:

Countries (e.g., 5).

3 industries with fixed hierarchies per country.

Government hierarchy per country.

Initial adult population and youth pipeline.

Deterministic stats and development curves.

Simplified daily/weekly simulation:

Industry and government performance.

Basic employment and movement.

Aging, births, deaths.

Yearly competition and ranking:

Simple composite score.

Champion label per year.

Basic awards:

Top industry performers.

Government MVP.

Country of the Year.

History tracking:

Yearly rankings.

Basic award logs.

Future expansions can deepen:

Education systems.

Election mechanics.

More detailed migration and crisis modeling.

Advanced event systems.

More nuanced personality and relationship modeling.

But the core BBGM-style experience—managing roles, stats, performance, and championships over time—must work first.
