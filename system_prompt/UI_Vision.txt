🌍 WORLD SIM BBGM — UI VISION DOCUMENT (v1.1)

A unifying design guide for the visual identity, layout structure, and UI components of the World Sim BBGM interface.

Last updated: BBGM “single-sheet” layout adoption

1. UI Philosophy

World Sim BBGM inherits its design identity from Basketball GM. The UI should feel like a single dense sheet of information, not a collection of floating cards.

Core principles:

Data-forward – Tables, stats, and text-first presentation. Numbers and lists are the primary visual elements.

Dense layout – Minimal whitespace, compact rows, small fonts. Everything important is visible at once.

Flat, single-sheet design – One white content surface with sections and tables, not lots of rounded panels.

Zero-friction navigation – Side nav + top nav, predictable locations for important links.

Fast scanning – Strong page titles, small section headings, consistent ordering of sections.

BBGM-like, not BBGM-cloned – Match structure, density, and flow; don’t copy assets or artwork.

Consistency > decoration – A few well-defined patterns used everywhere.

Utility-first – The user should feel like a GM managing a country via numbers, not like a casual app user.

This document defines how layouts, typography, and shared components work to support that philosophy.

2. Global Layout Model

All major pages share a consistent UI shell:

2.1 Top Navigation Bar

Appears on every page.

Content

Left:

Game emoji/logo (🌍 for now)

“World Sim BBGM” title, linking to /

Center:

Current world name

Current simulated year (e.g., “SimWorld 1 · Year 8”)

Right:

Button: Sim 1 Year

Button: Reset World

Link: My Country (/player)

Search icon (global person/company search; can stub initially)

Style

Background: white

Height: ~48px

Bottom border: 1px solid #ddd

Font size: 12–14px

No shadows; flat.

2.2 Left Sidebar Navigation

Used on all game pages.

Sections and Links

WORLD

Standings

Top Companies

History (future)

Awards (future)

Events (future)

COUNTRY

Dashboard (/player)

Industries

Country History

Government (future)

Finances (future)

PEOPLE

Youth Pipeline

Leaders

People Search (future)

Notable Families (future)

COMPANIES

All Companies

Industry Leaders (future)

Ranking Charts (future)

Style

Width: ~220–240px

Background: white

Right border: 1px solid #ddd

Section headers: all-caps, 11px, medium weight, grey (#777)

Links: 12–13px; active state blue background; hover subtle grey.

2.3 Main Content “Sheet”

All content to the right of the sidebar sits in a single centered white sheet, like BBGM:

Outer page background: light grey #f2f2f2

Inner content: max-w-6xl white container

Vertical padding: 12–16px

Horizontal padding: 12–16px

Optional vertical borders: border-x border-gray-200

All sections (standings, snapshot, headlines, etc.) live directly on this sheet. We generally avoid wrapping them in separate cards or panels.

2.4 Page Types

Every page uses one of these sheet layouts:

A. Dashboard Layout (3-column)

Used for:

/ (world overview)

/player (controlled country dashboard)

Future league/country dashboards

Columns

Left: mini-standings, context tables, quick links

Center: main dashboard content (scores, stats, leaders)

Right: headlines, news/events, quick facts

Grid

Desktop: grid-cols-12

Left: col-span-3

Center: col-span-6

Right: col-span-3

On smaller screens, columns stack.

B. Two-Column Layout

Used for:

Company page

Person page

Country page

Columns

Left (main): performance tables, attributes, charts, timelines

Right (sidebar): quick facts, depth charts, small summaries

Grid

Left: col-span-8

Right: col-span-4

C. Full-Width Table Layout

Used when the entire view is a list:

Standings

Rankings

Awards lists

Top companies

Spec

Content sheet still used, but a single column

Margins: 12–24px inside the sheet

Table fills available width.

3. Component Library (UI System)

We still use shared components, but cards/panels are no longer the default building block. The default look is flat sections + tables.

3.1 Flat Section Pattern (Default)

The canonical building block is:

A section heading

Optional subtext

One or more tables or short lists

Example:

Heading: “World snapshot”

Subtext: “Key indicators for Year 8”

Content: definition list, small stat blocks, buttons.

Style

Heading: 12px, semi-bold, normal case (NOT all caps)

Subtext: 11px, grey (#777)

Section spacing: 8–16px between sections

No surrounding card; background is the page sheet.

3.2 Panel / Card Component (Secondary)

Panels are special-purpose, not default layout. Use them sparingly when:

Content must pop from surrounding noise (e.g., headlines, alerts)

A bounded area makes the UI clearer (e.g., modal, popover, sidebox)

Style

Background: white

Border: 1px solid #ddd

Border radius: 4–6px

Padding: 8–12px

No heavy shadows (light or none)

Rules:

Avoid nesting panels (no >1 level deep)

Do not wrap whole pages in a grid of panels; rely on flat sections instead.

3.3 Table Component (Primary)

Tables are the core of the UI.

Appearance

Font size: 12px

Row height: compact (24–30px)

Background: white

Row striping: optional and subtle; single background is fine

Row border: 1px solid #eee or lighter

Header:

11px, uppercase or small caps

Bold or semi-bold

Bottom border stronger than row borders

Numbers right-aligned, names left-aligned

Interaction

Cell text links where appropriate (countries, companies, people)

Clicking a row may navigate to a detail page; if so, cursor should indicate clickability.

Optional sort by clicking headers (future)

Tables should feel exactly like BBGM: tight, informative, un-fancy.

3.4 Depth Chart / Hierarchy Component

Used for:

Company hierarchies

Government offices

Org charts

Structure

One row per role

Columns:

Role name

Person name (link)

Fit / rating badge

Optional lock/flag icon

Style

Effectively a thin table

Row height: 26–30px

No heavy card; usually just heading + table.

3.5 Headline Card

Used mainly in right-hand dashboard columns.

Content types

Awards

Promotions / hirings

Retirements

Champions / titles

Major events (future)

Visual

Small bordered box in a vertical list

Optional avatar/icon on the left; text to the right

Tag badges (color-coded) for Award / Retirement / Movement, etc.

Text is 11–12px, two lines max

These are one of the few legitimate “card-like” elements that stand apart from flat tables.

3.6 Tabs Component (Future)

Tabs across top of detail views:

Overview

History

Ratings / Stats

Roles

Events (future)

Style

Text-only tabs

No big cards; active tab underlined and slightly bolder

Tab bar sits directly on the white sheet.

3.7 Typography Rules

Headings

Page title: 18–20px, bold

Major section titles: 12px, semi-bold

Label text (table headers, small labels): 11px

Body

Main body text: 12–13px

Table rows: 12px

Subtext / captions: 11px, grey (#777)

Line height: tight (1.2–1.3)

Typography should always favor readability at high density over big, airy text.

3.8 Color Palette
Use case	Color
Outer background	#f2f2f2
Content sheet background	#ffffff
Borders	#dddddd (headers), #eeeeee (rows)
Hover row	#eef3ff
Text primary	#222222
Text secondary	#555555
Links	#0066cc (underline on hover)
Positive / up arrow	#10b981
Negative / down arrow	#ef4444
Warning badge	#facc15

Muted colors, no gradients. Visual interest comes from data, not theming.

3.9 Spacing System

Use a small-scale spacing system:

XS: 2–4px (between text and labels)

SM: 6–8px (between heading and content)

MD: 12px (between sections)

LG: 16px (between major blocks / columns)

Avoid big blank bands of whitespace. The UI should feel compact and purposeful.

4. Page-by-Page Vision (Blueprint)
4.1 / — World Overview Dashboard

Single-sheet, 3-column layout:

Left (col-span-3)

“Standings” mini-table:

Rank, Country, Score, Δ

“Countries” bullet list

Center (col-span-6)

“World snapshot”:

Year, Countries, People, Companies

Sim 1 Year / Reset World / My Country buttons

“Top companies this year” table:

Rank, Company, Country, Industry, Output

Right (col-span-3)

“League headlines”:

Small headline cards, 2–3 lines each

“People (sample)” list

No big wrapper cards. Sections are separated by headings and small gaps only.

4.2 /player — Controlled Country Dashboard

Same 3-column skeleton:

Left

Mini standings with controlled country highlighted

Simple schedule / recent results (future)

Center

Big country summary (score and rank) at the top

Stats blocks:

CompanyScore, GovernmentScore, YouthScore, etc.

Tables:

Top companies in this country

Top ministers/executives

Right

Headlines specific to this country

Key events and alerts (e.g., cabinet changes, company bankruptcies)

Again: flat sections over a single sheet.

4.3 /world/[id]/standings

Full-width table page on the sheet.

Main table:

Rank, Country, Total Score, Company Score, Gov Score, Rank Δ

Beneath:

Per-industry summary tables

Optional “Top companies” table

All of this is one continuous scroll, not separate cards.

4.4 /company/[id]

Two-column layout.

Left (main)

Company summary inline (name, industry, country)

Table for current-year performance vs league average

Mini history table (Year, Output, Rank)

Right (sidebar)

Depth chart table (roles → people)

Quick facts: founded year, size, prestige, etc.

Sections are just headings + tables.

4.5 /person/[id]

Two-column layout, BBGM player-page analog.

Left

Name + age header

Attributes grid (cognition, leadership, reliability, personality)

Career tables:

Education history

Employment history

Offices held

Yearly performance line (from PersonYearPerformance)

Right

Quick facts:

Country, industries, potential, prestige, etc.

Small highlight/headline boxes (if awards / championships)

4.6 /country/[id]

Two-column layout.

Left

Country performance over years (table or chart)

Champion markers / rank over time

Industry summary table

Right

Government hierarchy table

Key stats: population, GDP proxy, champions, prestige

5. Interaction Rules

All clickable names (people, companies, countries) are blue and underline on hover.

Table rows with row-level actions should change background on hover.

Up/down changes shown with green ↑ and red ↓.

Sorting by clicking headers is ideal (can be rolled out gradually).

Modals and overlays use a simple, flat card — same palette, no heavy shadows.

6. Future Extensions Supported by This Vision

This “single-sheet + tables” UI easily extends to:

Awards (tables + inline surfacing on player/company/country pages)

Season recap events

International movement and transfers

Prestige curves and titles

Country management menus

Hall of Fame

Long-form news/event feeds

Save/load UI

Because we avoid panel explosion and stick to headings + tables, new features plug in cleanly.

7. Non-Goals

We explicitly are not aiming for:

Fancy card grids everywhere

Large, airy, marketing-style layouts

Heavy animations or transitions

Portrait-heavy player cards (beyond small avatars)

Dark mode (for now)

Mobile-first layouts (desktop is primary; mobile comes later)

Goal: clarity, density, and a GM-simulator feel, not visual flash.

8. Deliverables for UI Sprint 1 (Aligned with This Vision)

For the first UI sprint under this vision:

World layout shell (GameLayout) with:

Top nav

Sidebar

Centered sheet

World overview (/) redesigned to sheet-style 3-column dashboard

Country dashboard (/player) implemented with same pattern

Standings page UI updated to dense full-width table

Shared “flat table” styling for standings, top companies, and leaders

Initial headline cards on world and player dashboards

Once this is in place, every future screen should copy these patterns:
flat white sheet, tight sections, and table-first design.
