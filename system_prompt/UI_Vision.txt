🌍 WORLD SIM BBGM — UI VISION DOCUMENT (v1.0)

A unifying design guide for the visual identity, layout structure, and UI components of the World Sim BBGM interface.

Last updated: UI Modernization Sprint Start

1. UI Philosophy

World Sim BBGM inherits its design identity from Basketball GM:

Data-forward: tables, stats, and text-first presentation

Dense information layout: minimal whitespace, compact rows

Minimalistic visual design: avoid ornamentation, focus on clarity

Zero-friction navigation: side nav, top nav, consistent links

Fast scanning: bold titles, descriptive section headers, predictable positions

BBGM-like structure but NOT copying assets

Consistency over decoration — every panel looks and behaves the same

Utility-first — the player must feel like a “GM managing a country” through numbers, lists, and dashboards

This document defines the exact components, layouts, colors, and behaviors that the UI must follow.

2. Global Layout Model

All major pages share a consistent UI shell, composed of:

2.1 Top Navigation Bar

Appears on every page.

Left:

Game logo / emoji (🏛️ or 🏀 or 🌍 depending on eventual branding)

Game title: World Sim BBGM

Link to homepage/world overview

Current world name

Current simulated year

(Optional) Context text like: “Year 46 — Midseason”

2.3 Page Types

Every page must adopt one of three layout templates:

(Later) league overview dashboards

Columns:

C. Full-Width Table Layout

Used when the entire screen is a list:

Table occupies 100% width inside main content container.

3. Component Library (UI System)

All reusable UI components must follow this spec.

White background

Border: 1px solid #ddd

Border radius: 6px

Card nesting:

You MAY put panels inside panels, but avoid >2 levels deep.

3.2 Table Component

3.8 Spacing System

Use an 4/8/16 scale:

XS: 4px

SM: 8px

MD: 12px

LG: 16px

XL: 24px

Avoid big empty spaces — BBGM is compact.

4. Page-by-Page Vision (Blueprint)

This section outlines how each major page should look once converted.

4.1 /player — Controlled Country Dashboard

3-column layout identical to BBGM team dashboard:

Left:

Mini standings

Controlled country highlighted

Center:

Large “record” equivalent:

e.g., Country Score 1034 (2nd of 5)

Panels:

Team Leaders (top contributors)

Team Stats (companyScore, govScore, avg company output)

Youth Stars (top prospects)

Finances or Economy (placeholder)

Right:

Headlines

Event cards

“Top companies this year” or “Rising talent”

4.2 /company/[id]

BBGM team page analog.

Left:

Performance summary card

Industry benchmark card

Peers list

Year-by-year history chart (bar chart)

Right:

Company hierarchy depth chart

Role-fit icons

Lock icons

4.3 /world/[id]/standings

BBGM standings page analog:

Single wide table

Columns: Country, Total Score, Company Score, Gov Score, Rank Δ

Below main table:

Per-industry breakdown

Top companies list

4.4 /person/[id]

BBGM player profile analog:

Left:

Name + age header

Stat attributes grid (cognitive, leadership, reliability, personality)

Performance trend (from PersonYearPerformance)

History of employment, education, offices, company roles

4.5 /country/[id]

Country equivalent of “Team History”:

5. Interaction Rules

All clickable text → blue and underlined on hover

All tables sortable by clicking headers

All person/company names are links

All hover rows highlight

All stats show green/red for positive/negative movement

All modals use standardized panel style

Lock icons toggle inline with minimal animation

6. Future Extensions Supported by This Vision

This UI structure supports all medium-term roadmap features:

Awards (list + per-person surfacing)

Season recap events

International movement highlights

Prestige visualization

Country management menu

Hall of Fame

Event log / news feed

Personality-driven storylines

Save/load UI

The vision is intentionally stable so UI work never needs rewriting.

7. Non-Goals

This UI vision intentionally rejects:

flashy animations

overly modern “Airbnb”-style spacing

dark mode (for now)

portrait-heavy layout (unless optional)

mobile-first design (full management sims are desktop-biased)

Goal is clarity, density, and strategic feel, not beauty.

8. Deliverables for UI Sprint 1 (Based on This Vision)

In this sprint, the UI team will implement:

GameLayout shell (top nav + sidebar)

Three-column Player Dashboard

Shared Component Library

Company Page UI v2

Standings UI v2

Person Page UI v2

These directly correspond to:

Tickets 23–28 in the roadmap

Achieving the “80–90% BBGM similarity” goal
